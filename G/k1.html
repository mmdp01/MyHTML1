<h2>Travelling Information</h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTravelling to Araku Valley is easy for Indian citizens without the need of taking any permission. For foreign tourists however, the need for visa permission is mandatory. Foreign nationals must submit an application stating the reason and duration of the visit. Only after clearance from the Indian government they can visit Araku Valley.In order to reach Araku we need to reach Visakhapatnam.</p>
<h3>Travelling From Vizag:</h3><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom here you can go either by rialways or roadways.But there is only one train that takes you to Araku from Visakhapatnam at a proper time (Train no. 58501). The train is scheduled to reach Araku at 11am but often it reaches at 12 noon. You can do your journey as follows. Get down at Araku and get hold of a jeep/car that will take you to all the '7 spots' which are worth seeing in and around Araku.The spots include Tribal museum, Katiki waterfalls, Botanical garden, Coffee plantation, railway tracks (additional), Borra caves (covered at the end) and some more in no specific order. Visiting all spots except Borra should not take more than 3.5 hours. Katiki waterfalls can take 30 mins if you don't intend to take a bath otherwise you can easily spend upto 2 hours here enjoying the water and scenic beauty. The best amongst all is Borra Guhalu (caves) which should be given at least 1 hour for proper viewing. You should reach Borra by 4pm. The train from Borra to Vizag is scheduled at 5.15pm but is often late by more than an hour so even if you reach Borra late, it shouldn't be an issue. Even if you miss the train there are many buses to Vizag at reasonable rates. Given that you have already enjoyed the train scenes while coming to Araku, it shouldn't be a problem doing the return journey by bus. I didn't find anything special that can be bought from there but you should try Bamboo chicken which is sort of a specialty there and tastes very good.</p>
