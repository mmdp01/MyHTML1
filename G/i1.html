<h2><b><u>Facilities at Araku:</u></b></h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAraku being a popular tourist spot in Vizag district,the Govt of Andhra Pradesh has established a organization under the name of "Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation" which has tied up with APSRTC and local hotels to provide better transport and best stay experience at Araku. Interested tourists can register their holiday booking with AP Tourisim through their website at <a href="https://tourism.ap.gov.in/home">APTDC</a><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut their are some private tourist operators who also does the same thing as APTDC does. They too offer  facilities on par with what APTDC offers.Since APTDC is a government organization they are the most realible than the most private tourist operators.Tourists can select either APTDC or Private tourist operators for their holiday at Araku.
